# Birds Eye
## For now this script works for windows I'll update it later  ðŸ™ƒ
Ever wanted to spy on websites without them knowing? Look no further! This script, like a stealthy ninja, silently takes screenshots of URLs you give it. Want it to be even sneakier? It can do it without popping up any browser windows. It's the James Bond of web reconnaissance, equipped with its trusty Chrome or Firefox disguise. Just feed it a list of targets or a single URL, and watch as it captures the evidence, saving it all in a secret folder. Shaken, not stirred, of course.
## Installation

This script requires either Chrome WebDriver or Gecko (Firefox) WebDriver to function properly. Make sure you have one of them installed and accessible in your PATH.
