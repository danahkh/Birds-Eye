# Screenshot Reconnaissance Script

Welcome to the Screenshot Reconnaissance Script! This script helps you capture screenshots of URLs for reconnaissance purposes. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. **Set up a Virtual Environment:**
   First, let's set up a virtual environment to keep our dependencies isolated.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

2. Install Dependencies:
Next, install the required libraries using pip.

pip install selenium

Download WebDriver:
This script requires either Chrome WebDriver or Gecko (Firefox) WebDriver to function properly. Make sure you have one of them installed and accessible in your PATH.
Run the Script:
You're all set! Now you can run the script by providing either a file containing URLs or a single URL as an argument.

Optional: Add the -s/--slow flag to slow down the requests.
That's it! Enjoy capturing screenshots for your reconnaissance needs.


This file provides clear instructions for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, downloading the required WebDriver, and running the script. Let me know if you need any adjustments or if you have any specific preferences!
